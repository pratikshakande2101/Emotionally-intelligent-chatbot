# Emotionally Intelligent Chatbot: Text and Video Integration
An emotion-aware, multi-modal chatbot that analyzes **text sentiment** and **facial expressions from video** to generate emotionally intelligent responses. This project integrates Natural Language Processing and Computer Vision to create more human-like and empathetic interactions.

## Project Overview
Traditional chatbots rely only on text, which limits their ability to understand user emotions. This project enhances conversational intelligence by combining **text-based emotion detection** with **real-time facial emotion recognition** from video input, enabling context-aware and emotionally sensitive responses.

## Key Features
- Text sentiment and emotion analysis using **spaCy** and **Hugging Face Transformers**
- Real-time facial emotion recognition using **OpenCV** and **DeepFace**
- Emotion-aware chatbot responses using a pre-trained conversational model
- Web-based interactive interface with live webcam integration
- Multi-modal emotion fusion for improved response accuracy

## Technologies Used
- **Backend:** Flask (Python)
- **NLP:** spaCy, Hugging Face Transformers
- **Computer Vision:** OpenCV, DeepFace
- **Frontend:** HTML5, CSS3, JavaScript
- **Models:** Pre-trained sentiment, emotion, and conversational models
